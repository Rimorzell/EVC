    """
    Computes a binary image with the specified threshold x.

    Args:
        input_image: RGB image.
        x: Scalar threshold.
        top: If 0, the output should be inverted such that 0 becomes 1 and 1
          becomes 0.

    Returns:
        Binary RGB image which must contain either zeros or ones. The result has
        to be of type float! Make sure that all three channels are preserved
        (the operation has to be performed on every channel).
